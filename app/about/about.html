  <h3>Design Descisions</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>I have used some functionality of Javascript ES6, so it will only work in the latest version of browsers. I assumed that
      the main build system will take this module and pack it into a suitable form.</li>
    <li>I choose AngularJS 1.6 used by S4RB, which I had never used before to demostrate that I am capable to pick up new frameworks
      quickly.</li>
    <li>I used Bootstrap as it proveds a standard responsive look and feel, quickly and easily</li>
    <li>
      The controllers:
      <ul>
        <li>I used an hierarchical controller system so that each controller has an defined api for providing data to the view
          system and new views (e.g. yearly) can be added easily.</li>
        <li>MainCtrl is responsible for obtaining the data from the server.</li>
        <li>MainCtrl provides some utility functions which to workout the CPMU and Date translations. If in the future requirements
          came in where these functions are used elsewhere it would be worth to put them in a seperate service.</li>
        <li>RawCtrl, MonthlyCtrl and QuarterlyCtrl provide a getData() method which returns the data in a format suitable for
          that view.The original idea was for getData() to only calculate the data when needed. I found that I needed to
          store the generated data.</li>
        <li>MonthlyCtrl takes the data from the MainCtrl, works out the date range and generates an array with data for each
          Month.</li>
        <li>QuarterlyCtrl takes the data from the MainCtrl, works out the date range and aggregates the data in to sections.
          Currently it does not note when any months are missing from the quarter</li>
        <li>The CPMU is currently worked out in the view. If the computation of CPMU was more CPU intensive I would work this
          out when generating the model for the controller. This is a basic storage/computation trade off.</li>
      </ul>
    </li>
  </ul>
